This project is a demo of single-spa, a javascript router for micro-frontends.

It currently contains:
1. A root-config; The base router and import map for different single page applications (SPAs)
2. A create-react-app application, routed to '/react' in our SPA.
3. A vue application, routed to '/vue' in our SPA.
